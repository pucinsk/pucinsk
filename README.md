### Hi there, I'm [Jokūbas](https://github.com/pucinsk)

Back-end oriented Software Developer. I have been using Ruby/Rails to solve problems, create applications for the last 6 years. I am passionate about good practices, testing and writing scalable code. A small part of me is a front-end developer who codes JavaScript and creates interactive UIs with ReactJS.
